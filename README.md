Bang-Bang
=========

I really like [Duckduckgo].
In particular, I like what they call the [bangs][duckduckgo-bangs].

But I wanted:

- To have the choice. It's never a good thing to be stuck with a product because
  there's a non-core feature that you like. And since the bang mechanisms has
  nothing to do with a search engine in particular, why not separate them?

- To be able to customize my bangs. Because customization is cool.

- To have something really lightweight and fast. This is not much but it can
  matter for some people.

Anyway. **Installation** is easy:
- Copy this project somewhere in your web path;
- In directory `cfg/`, copy one of the example config files as `bang-bang.ini`;
- In this `cfg/bang-bang.ini` file, edit the `[site]` section;
- You should be good to go.
